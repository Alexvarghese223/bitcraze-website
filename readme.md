# The Bitcraze website

This is the source code for the Bitcraze website. The web has been running on 
Wordpress but we now want to move as much as possible to git to enable the 
community to cotribute and also to be more open. The blog will still run on 
Wordpress (not part of this repository) and will be injected in the pages 
generated by this project. 

This is very much work in progress, this readme will be updated when are in a 
stable state.

# TODO

* Add marker for the current menu
* Old products
* Add all content from the current site.
* Add edit button on all pages
