Components and  Hardware Architecture
-----------------------

The Crazyflie consists of many hardware components and LED's that have all their own functionalities. If you are curious about these components, take a look at [this](/docs/cf2_component_explanation/) to gain a better understanding. 

The two most important components of the Crazyflie are the microprocessors: the **STM32F4** handles the main Crazyflie firmware with all the low-level and high-level controls and the **NRF51822** handles all the radio communication and power management. 

 - For more detail about the hardware architecture, please check [this page](/docs/cf2_architecture/).
 - To learn more about the Crazyflie firmware on the STM32F4, please check [this page](/docs/crazyflie-firmware/master/index/).
 - To learn more about the firmware that runs on the NRF51822, please check [this page](/docs/crazyflie2-nrf-firmware/master/index/).


Expension decks

 The Crazyflie can be enhanced by adding [expansion decks](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks), which gives the Crazyflie extra capabilities in sensing, positioning or visualization. Please check this [page](/docs/cf2_expansiondecks/) to know more about our different expansion decks and what kind of different combination you can add on your Crazyflie.
