Components and  Hardware Architecture
-----------------------
The Crazyflie consists of many hardware components and LED's that have all their own functionalities. The two most important components of the Crazyflie are the microprocessors: the **STM32F4** handles the main Crazyflie firmware with all the low-level and high-level controls and the **NRF51822** handles all the radio communication and power management.

Expansion decks
-----------------------
|The Crazyflie can be enhanced by adding [expansion decks](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks), which gives the Crazyflie extra capabilities in sensing, positioning or visualization. Please read the documentation to know more about our different expansion decks and what kind of different combination you can add on your Crazyflie.
