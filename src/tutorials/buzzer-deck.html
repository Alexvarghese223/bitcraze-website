{% gs_intro The buzzer deck %}
The buzzer deck contains a low profile piezo buzzer and have a 1-wire memory which enables the Crazyflie to automatically detect the buzzer, 
the deck can be installed both on the top and the bottom of the Crazyflie.
To be able to use the buzzer you need to update the Crazyflie to the [latest firmware](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-release/releases).

If you need more information on how to install the latest firmware go to the [download latest firmware](https://www.bitcraze.io/getting-started-with-the-crazyflie-2-0/#infostep27) section in our getting started with Crazyflie 2.0 tutorial and follow the steps. 
For more information about how to mount an expansion deck please see the [Getting started with expansion decks](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-release/releases) tutorial.  
Note that the buzzer board should always be mounted before powering on the Crazyflie 2.0.
