Debug firmware with ease;
Connect a standard JTAG and SWD debugger to the Crazyflie 2.0.

One of our goals is to make development with the Crazyflie 2.0 as easy
as possible. Due to the small size of the platform there are limitations
in what connectors we can have and therefore we designed a debug-adapter
kit that makes connecting a debugger to either of the MCUs a lot
easier, by converting the connector pinouts to standard JTAG and SWD
pinouts.
