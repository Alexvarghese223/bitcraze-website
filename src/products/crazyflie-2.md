        We designed the Crazyflie 2.0 to be as flexible as we possibly
        could. For us this means adding as much features as we could fit and
        interconnecting as much things as we could. In addition to the
        functionality that comes with the Crazyflie 2.0 by default we have
        added a flexible expansion interface where multiple expansion decks
        can be added, both on the top and the bottom of the Crazyflie 2.0. From
        the interface the user can access the normal buses, like UART, I2C, SPI
        as well as PWM, analog in/out and GPIO.

    <h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane-o"></i>Weight matters</h2>
    <div class="pp-catch-phrase">The Crazyflie 2.0 only weighs 27g and fits in the palm of your hand.
        The size makes it’s ideal to fly inside a lab, office or your living
        room without trashing half of the interior.</div>

    <div id="WeightMatters" class="collapse">
        Having a nano quadcopter that only weighs 27g has a lot of
        advantages.
        For us the most important one is safety, durability and being
        usable
        inside. Even though the propellers spin at high RPMs, they are soft
        and
        the torque in the motors are very low compared to a brushless
        motor.
        The Crazyflie 2.0 is pretty fast if you let it be, but even if it
        crashes into the walls and ceiling it&#8217;s still only 27g which
        means the kinetic energy involved in a crash is fairly low. That
        being
        said, there will still be a violent crash! The system design is
        made in
        a way to break at the cheapest part, the motor mounts. If you break
        a
        motor mount you can get 4 new ones for $5 and easily replace them.
        Because of it&#8217;s size it&#8217;s a quadcopter that&#8217;s
        ideal
        to fly inside a lab, office or your living room, but you can still
        take
        it outside where you will have enough space to really show the
        performance.

        We think that a development platform should be something more than
        just
        making the code available. Therefore we have put a lot of effort
        into
        creating software, firmware and utilities to make development
        easier.
        Instead of spending time installing all the tool-chains, download
        and
        use our virtual machine. It contains everything needed to build all
        the
        firmwares, modify the electronics and run our Python client. Since
        all
        of our development tools are open source, except for iOS, we are
        allowed to redistribute them in an easy way for our users. Once you
        have made the modifications you want, just flash the new firmware
        over
        the radio and you are ready to go.

        The Crazyflie 2.0 is an open source project, with source code and
        hardware design available and documented. The platform is designed
        with
        development in mind, implementing features to make development
        easier
        and faster, such as logging and real-time parameter setting and
        wireless firmware update. The complete development environment for
        most
        of the projects is available in the virtual machine, so you don&#8217;t
        need to install any toolchains to get into the development. But the
        virtual machine can just as well be used for flying. Aside from the
        firmware and software projects, there is also a number of community
        supported APIs written in Java, Ruby, C/C++, C# and Javascript. For
        anyone interested in doing more advanced development there is a
        development adapter kit that supports easy JTAG/SWD connection to
        both
        of the MCUs on the Crazyflie 2.0.

        Even though the Crazyflie 2.0 is very small and light, it packs a
        lot of
        power. It features 4 x 7mm coreless DC-motors that will give it a
        maximum takeoff weight of 42g. This gives you enough capacity to
        extend
        the Crazyflie with one of our expansions decks or adding your own
        experiments. When using one of our clients to fly the quadcopter
        you
        can set flight performance parameters in real-time. Tuning these
        parameters you can set the angles of the platform to be high, which
        will give you a lot of speed and aggressiveness when flying. Or you
        can
        lower them to make it easier to start out with. Have a look at our

        Even though the Crazyflie 2.0 is made to be expandable and the
        firmware
        is made to be modified, everything you need to fly is already
        there.
        The Crazyflie 2.0 is charged via uUSB, the same connector most
        modern
        mobile devices use. It’s also equipped with low-latency/long-range
        radio as well as Bluetooth LE. This gives you the versatility of
        using
        your computer to display data and being able to fly it with a game
        pad,
        while still being able to just take it out and fly it from your
        mobile
        device to show off. The board also contains a EEPROM memory for
        storing
        configuration parameters and a 10-DOF IMU with accelerometer, gyro,
        magnetometer and a high precision pressure sensor.

        When we designed the Crazyflie 2.0 we wanted as many people as
        possible
        to be able to get something out of it. If you don’t like
        programming
        and hardware development, then just assemble your Crazyflie 2.0 and
        download the Android or iPhone app and fly around. You could also
        add
        some of our expansion boards to get more features out of your
        Crazyflie
        2.0. If you are into programming but not embedded systems, then
        have a
        look at our Python API and client, there’s always things we need to
        improve or add. Or if you are not into Python, have a look at some
        of
        the many client-side implementations that exist on GitHub written
        in
        Ruby, C#, C/C++, JavaScript, Node.JS, Cylon.JS or Java. Or why not
        clone our iOS repository and get into some ObjectiveC. But if you
        are
        into embedded then there’s lots of resources that you can use in
        our
        STM32F405 for doing experiments, improvements and new features.
        Finally
        we have the expansion port that allows you to easily experiment,
        prototype and design your own hardware. All the files and
        information
        you need will be available freely on our webpage.

        we will also continue to design new expansion decks at regular
        intervals, which means you can keep doing new things with the
        Crazyflie
        2.0 you already have. The platform supports wireless firmware
        updates
        via radio and Bluetooth LE, so when a new new firmware is released
        it&#8217;s
        a breeze to update.
