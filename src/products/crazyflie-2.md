        Even though the Crazyflie 2.0 is made to be expandable and the
        firmware is made to be modified, everything you need to fly is already
        there. The Crazyflie 2.0 is equipped with low-latency/long-range
        radio as well as Bluetooth LE. This gives you the versatility of
        using your computer to display data and being able to fly it with a game
        pad, or download our app and use your smart phone as a controller. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The Crazyflie 2.0 is charged via uUSB so you don't need a additional charger 
        for your Crazyflie 2.0 just connect it to your computer.
        The board contains a EEPROM memory for storing configuration parameters and a 10-DOF IMU with accelerometer, gyro,
        magnetometer and a high precision pressure sensor.

      We designed the Crazyflie 2.0 to be as flexible as we possibly could, for us this means adding as much features as we could fit. 
      In addition to the default functionality that comes with the Crazyflie 2.0 we have added a flexible expansion interface where a variety of expansion 
      decks can be attached, both on the top and the bottom of the Crazyflie 2.0. From the interface the user can access the buses, 
      like UART, I2C, SPI as well as PWM, analog in/out and GPIO.

We designed the Crazyflie 2.0 to be as flexible as we possibly

interconnecting as much things as we could. In addition to the
functionality that comes with the Crazyflie 2.0 by default we have
added a flexible expansion interface where multiple expansion decks

    <h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane-o"></i>Weight matters</h2>
    <div class="pp-catch-phrase">The Crazyflie 2.0 only weighs 27g and fits in the palm of your hand.
        The size makes it’s ideal to fly inside a lab, office or your living
        room without trashing half of the interior.</div>

        <p>
        Having a nano quadcopter that only weighs 27g has a lot of
        advantages. For us the most important one is safety, durability and being
        usable inside. Even though the propellers spin at high RPMs, they are soft
        and the torque in the motors are very low compared to a brushless
        motor. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The Crazyflie 2.0 is pretty fast if you let it be, but even if it
        crashes it's still only 27g which means the kinetic energy involved in a crash is fairly low. The system is designed to         break at the cheapest part, the motor mount, that are availible as spare parts.

        <p>The Crazyflie 2.0 features 4 x 7mm coreless DC-motors that gives the Crazyflie a
        maximum takeoff weight of 42g. This capacity enables it to carry multiple expansions decks, maybe with one of your own
        experiments.
        Performance parameters can be set in real-time from our clients.
        By tuning these parameters you can set the angles of the platform to be high, which
        will give you a lot of speed and aggressiveness when flying. Or you
        can lower them to make it easier to start out with.

        <p>We think that a development platform should be something more than
        just making the code available, therefore the software, firmware 
        and utilities have functionality such as logging and real-time parameter setting and
        wireless firmware update. The complete development environment for 
        most of the projects is available in a virtual machine, so you 
        don't need to install any toolchains to start developing and the 
        virtual machine can just as well be used for flying.</p><p>Once you
        have made the modifications you want, just flash the new firmware
        over the radio and you are ready to go. 
        For anyone interested in doing more advanced development there is a
        development adapter kit that supports easy JTAG/SWD connection to
        both of the MCUs on the Crazyflie 2.0.

        <p>he Crazyflie 2.0 is an open source project, with source code and

        Since all of our development tools are open source, except for iOS, we are
        allowed to redistribute them in an easy way for our users. Aside from the
        firmware and software projects, there is also a number of community
        supported APIs written in Java, Ruby, C/C++, C# and Javascript.

        There are ampel oportunities to play with the code regardless of which language you prefer. 
        Our client API is written in Python, while there are many other client-side implementations on GitHub written
        in Ruby, C#, C/C++, JavaScript, Node.JS, Cylon.JS or Java.
        Or why not clone our iOS repository and get into some ObjectiveC/Swift.

        If you are into embedded systems, there is a lot of processor power that you can use in
        the STM32F405 for doing experiments, improvements and new features.
        </p>
        <p>        
        Finally we have the expansion port that allows you to easily experiment,
        prototype and design your own hardware.
