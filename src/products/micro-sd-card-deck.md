The micro SD card deck adds the possibility to read and write data to a micro
SD card. Maybe you have the need to store a lot of log data and the bandwidth
of the radio is not enough? Write it to a SD card and slot it into you computer
for instant access. Or write a configuration file to the SD card in your
computer and move the SD card to your Crazyfile. Perfect for a swarm when you
want to configure individuals without building and flashing firmware for each
of them.
