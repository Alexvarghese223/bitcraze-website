The Multi-ranger deck uses a 5 laser sensors to measure the distance in the directions front/back/left/right/up.
This enables the Crazyflie to detect proximity to objects at up to two meters.

With the Multi-ranger deck and the [Flow deck](/flow-deck), the Crazyflie becomes an interactive autonomous platform.
It has the capability to sense the space around it and to react to it.

This allows for simple interactivity like obstacle avoidance.
Thanks to the Crazyflie python API, it is easy to read the distance sensor measurements like in the push example described in the [getting started guide](/getting-started-with-stem-plus-drone-bundle).

It also allows to start working on environment-aware problems like Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithms.
