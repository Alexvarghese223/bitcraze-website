Add your own hardware;
Build your own expansion deck and add to your Crazyflie 2.0.
%}

Add a prototyping area to your Crazyflie 2.0 and lift your electronics
into the air. Just solder directly on the expansion deck and plug it
into the expansion port. Maybe try to add a few LEDs or a new sensor to detect
properties of the world around the Crazyflie?
