Optical flow breakout board for motion detection
%}

The Flow breakout board is used for motion tracking and can easily be connected to any robotics project or other design.

The motion of a surface, usually the ground, is measured and is reported as
delta X and delta Y by the optical flow sensor. The absolute distance (Z) is measured
by the Time of Flight ranging sensor. It comes with an Arduino library to easily
read the movement data and has a large voltage range for IO and power supply.

The Flow breakout features the VL53L0x ToF sensor and the PMW3901 optical flow sensor.
