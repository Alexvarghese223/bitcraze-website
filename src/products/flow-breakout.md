Optical flow breakout board for motion detection

The Flow breakout can easily be connected to any robotics or other designs where motion tracking might be interesting.
It has a pre-made Arduino library to read out movements and has a large voltage range for IO and power supply.

The Flow breakout features the VL53L0x ToF sensor and the PMW3901 optical flow sensor.
Together they enable you to measure the movement and distances.
