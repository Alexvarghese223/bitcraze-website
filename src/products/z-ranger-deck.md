Laser ranging;
Adds the possibility to fly with precise height control.
%}

The Z-ranger deck uses a laser sensor to measure the distance to the ground. 
The deck enables the Crazyflie to automatically maintain a constant distance to the 
objects under it when flying in automatic mode. Over a floor it will stay on the 
same height, but will follow the flow of a stair case up or down when going on 
adventures. 

The maximum range for the ranger is 2 meters.
