Enabling robotics and equipment to be integrated with the Loco positioning system
%}

Using the Roadrunner you can enable other robots and equipment to be integrated
with the Loco positioning system. The Roadrunner uses the same firmware-base
as the Crazyflie and will merge UWB measurements together with the IMU data to
get better positioning precision.

Using the Loco positioning system you will get the position directly in the
Roadrunner, but it's also possible to send it to a central point using a low
latency 2.4 GHz radio.
