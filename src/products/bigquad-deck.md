With the BigQuad deck you can transform your Crazyflie 2.0 to a bigger quad by connecting external ESCs to the breakout connectors on the deck. The autodetection of the deck makes this transformation possible to do in seconds. The deck also contains breakout header connectors for additional accessories such as external receiver (CPPM input) and GPS. It can also monitor battery voltage and current.
