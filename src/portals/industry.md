## Use the Crazyflie as an evaluation and reference platform
------

The Crazyflie is used by sensor manufacturers as a demonstrator to show the potential
of their sensors. Giving the customer a first hand view of the performance of a
sensor in a real flying application is a powerful way to showcase its properties.
The small size and light weight makes it safe to fly when meeting customers or in the lab.

#### Reference and evaluation decks

An expansion deck is a perfect reference and evaluation board for a sensor. The
design of a deck is usually very simple and clearly demonstrates the electrical properties, and
when plugged into the Crazyflie all the power and functionality of the
host platform is available. The customer has the possibility to try settings and  
configurations and to evaluate the results when actually flying a real drone.
Since all software, firmware and tools are open source, there are no limits to
what can be tested from bits and bytes on the lowest level to high level
features such as autonomous flight.

#### Deck design

The flexibility and simplicity of the Crazyflie expansion bus makes it easy and
cost efficient to design decks for new sensors with a short time to market.
The Crazyflie platform is already a fully functional quadcopter and all that is
needed from a firmware point of view is to add a driver.
