## Bring the latest in robotics to your students 
------

#### Engaging
The crazyflie is a versatile development platform that is made to engage people to learn about robotics and quadcopters.
Help the students acquire knowledge in areas like control algorithms, embedded systems, aeronautics or robotics by verifying their insights on a real quadcopter. Source code and hardware design is open and available to allow exploration and modification.

#### Flexible
The Crazyflie 2.0 is equipped with a flexible expansion interface to where a variety of expansion decks can be attached. Since the source and hardware design is open, it is also possible to add your own sensors or interface other hardware.The expansion decks adds new functionality to the Crazyflie that extends the reach of potential interest areas and makes the Crazyflie a great tool for education where both teachers and students can rely on an evolving platform.

#### Support
In addition to providing a great platform for learning we have created several “easy to follow” tutorials to get started with both setting up the Crazyflie and to start with development, we also have an active community on our forum that always try to help out.

#### Size
Since the crazyflie fits in the palm of your hand and only weighs 27g it’s ideal to fly inside the classroom and reduces the need for safety precautions.
