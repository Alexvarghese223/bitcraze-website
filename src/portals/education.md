## Bring the latest in robotics to your students 
------

#### Engaging
The crazyflie is a versatile development platform that is made to engage people to learn about robotics and quadcopters.
Help the students acquire knowledge in areas like control algorithms, embedded systems, aeronautics or robotics by verifying their insights on a real quadcopter. Source code and hardware design is open and available to allow exploration and modification.

#### Flexible
The Crazyflie 2.0 is equipped with a flexible expansion interface to where a variety of expansion decks can be attached. Since the source and hardware design is open, it is also possible to add your own sensors or interface other hardware.The expansion decks adds new functionality to the Crazyflie that extends the reach of potential interest areas and makes the Crazyflie a great tool for education where both teachers and students can rely on an evolving platform.

#### Support
In addition to providing a great platform for learning we have created several “easy to follow” tutorials to get started with both setting up the Crazyflie and to start with development, we also have an active community on our forum that always try to help out.

#### Size
Since the crazyflie fits in the palm of your hand and only weighs 27g it’s ideal to fly inside the classroom and reduces the need for safety precautions.


## Used by Chalmers

#### Associate Professor Knut Åkesson have chosen to incorporate the Crazyflie 2.0 as an educational platform for the course "Embedded control systems" at Chalmers University of Technology. 

During 8 weeks the students at **Chalmers University** gets introduced to the principles of design, specification, modeling, analysis and implementation of embedded control systems. The course is part of the **"Systems, control and mechatronics"** master program and the **"Biomedical engineering"** master program.

The Crazyflie 2.0 is introduced to the students when the course progresses from a theoretical level towards practical realization. Using the Crazyflie 2.0 as an educational platform gives the students the opportunity to test their work in real-life. 

***As an example the students build models of control systems for quadcopters using the Modelica language. They then design control algorithms based on the model and finally implement it on the Crazyflie 2.0.***

According to Knut a big benefit that was taken into consideration when incorporating the Crazyflie 2.0 as part of the teaching material is that the Crazyflie is an open platform, which makes it easy for the students to modify and implement their own algorithms. 
Using an open source tool also saves the teachers from the hassle dealing with licenses and limitations.

Another advantage is that traditional lab equipment is often very expensive and the time each student get to spend with the equipment is limited. 
Because of the Crazyflies price point the university can provide more students with the platform and let them bring it home and keep during the whole 8 week course. 

Safety is also a key issue that's been taken into consideration according to Knut. Because of the Crazyflies small size the teachers don’t have to prepare any major precautions before the students can start working with the platform.

#### Key points
* **An open platform**
* **The price point**
* **Safety because of size**
