**Love to fly? Like to tinker with toys? Want to modify and explore? Hate limitations and closed
systems? The Crazyflie is for you!**

Add decks for light and sound effects, or why not build your own deck? Create a
skin to make it look like your favourite flying creature or add a camera and
do First Person Flying. Use the Crazyflie on a bigger quadcopter frame and build
the optimal drone, tailored for your needs.
