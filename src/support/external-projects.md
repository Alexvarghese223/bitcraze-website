# External projects

There are a few external projects that are based on Bitcraze hardware and/or software.
We usually do not provide support for these projects but we have collected a few
links to help any one that is interested.

### Disclamer
These projects may or may not be actively maintained. We do not take any
responsibility for the functionality or compatibility in any way.

## Crazyflie firmware

Alternate firmware implementations for the Crazyflie

|![AdaCore](/images/icons/adacore_32.png)            | AdaCore has implemented the Crazyflie firmware in Ada. | [Blog post](http://blog.adacore.com/how-to-prevent-drone-crashes-using-spark), <https://github.com/AdaCore/Certyflie> |
|![PX4](/images/icons/px4_32.png)               |                                                        | <https://dev.px4.io/en/flight_controller/crazyflie2.html>                                                             |

## Crazyradio firmware

Alternate firmware implementations and uses for the Crazyradio

| NRF research firmware from Bastille Research  || <https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware> |
| MouseJack device discovery and research tools || <https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware> |

## Crazyflie simulator

Project aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the Crazyflie 2.0 nano-quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. 
 
| CrazyS | The University of Sannio in Benevento, Italy, has implemented a software-in-the-loop simulation platform for simulating Crazyflie behavior in the Gazebo 3D simulation environment. | <https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS> |

## Swarming

Projects aiming at supporting swarms. They might also be useful for controlling single Crazyflies.

| Crazyswarm | The ACT lab at USC has implemented a library to handle large swarms of Crazyflies. | <https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm> |
| ![ROS](/images/icons/ros_32.png) || <https://github.com/whoenig/crazyflie_ros> |
| Crazyserver | A server exposing a REST API to control a swarm of Crazyflies. Written in Go. | <https://github.com/mikehamer/crazyserver> |
| LaMoucheFolle | Cross-platform OSC server for controlling multiple Crazyflies 2.X | <https://github.com/benkuper/LaMoucheFolle> |

## Connectivity libraries

Libraries for connecting to the Crazyflie written in various languages. They are
usually implementing functionality similar to the Bitcraze python library.
