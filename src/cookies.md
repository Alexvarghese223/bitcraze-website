To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called
cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.

### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile
device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions
and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences)
over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you
come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

### How do we use cookies?

A number of our pages use cookies to remember:

* if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this site
* that you are logged in
* your preferences, such as colors or sort order of tables
* your gravatar

Some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.

Cookies are also stored when we use Google Analytics and Hotjar to collect
information on the usage of our site.
Read more about [how Google](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)
and [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/cookie-information) uses
data when you use our site.

We use Shopify for our store. Read about cookies in the store on the [Shopify
cookie page](https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies).

Enabling these cookies is necessary for some parts of the website to work while
it will provide you with a better browsing experience on other parts. You can
delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some features of this site
may not work as intended.

The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the
pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any
purpose other than those described here.

### How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – [for details, see aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/).
You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set
most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you
may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and
some services and functionalities may not work.
