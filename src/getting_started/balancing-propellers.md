  <h2 id="intro">Balancing propellers</h2>

<p>
Well balanced propellers reduces the vibrations in the copter and the noise in the
sensors, improving the stability of the Crazyflie. In most cases there is no 
need to balance the propellers, but if you want to do it this is how it's done.
</p>

<p>
You need:

  <ul>
    <li>A small round pin or needle</li>
    <li>Tape. Normal transparent office tape works well</li>
    <li>A pair of Scissors</li>
  </ul>
</p>

</div>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-check-propellers">checking the propeller</h3>
    <p>Start by checking if the propeller is well balanced. Do this by
    placing a propeller on a needle. Hold the propeller in a horizontal
    position and then release it, if it tilts over it is unbalanced. Balance
    the propeller by attaching a small piece of tape on the side that is
    pointing upwards.</p>

    <p>If the propeller is unbalanced attach tape to the convex side of the
    propeller as shown in the video. The amount of tape that should be used
    varies and you might need some tries to find the correct amount.</p>

    <h3 id="assembling-more-tape">add more tape if needed</h3>
    <p>After you have placed the first bit of tape try shaking the propellers a
    bit, if the propeller isn't tilting over anymore it's balanced.</p>
