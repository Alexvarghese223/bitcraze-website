    <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The Crazyflie 2.0 is tested extensively in the production, but to make sure nothing has happened during shipping/storage you should run the tests before starting the assembly. Power on the Crazyflie 2.0 using a USB source (either computer or charger) and check the results of the test below. Note that it’s important to keep the Crazyflie 2.0 still during the test and away from strong magnetic sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="testing-self-test">self-test</h3>
    <p>   Before you start assembling anything, run the power on self-test by
    connecting the Crazyflie 2.0 to a uUSB power source. The LEDs M1 and M4
    will indicate the result of the test. If the M4 LED blinks GREEN five times
    fast, then the test has passed.</p>

    <h2 id="assembling">Assembling</h2>
    <p>Assembling your Crazyflie 2.0 will probably take less than 10 minutes, but
    there’s a few pitfalls. So make sure to follow the instructions below!</p>
</div>
<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-twisting">twisting the wires</h3>
    <p>  Start by twist the wires of the four motors. This will reduce electronic
    noise an make the wires fit better in the motor mount “hooks”.</p>

    </div>

</div>
<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-motors">mount the motors</h3>
    <p>Push the four motors into the motor mounts. You will need some force to
    insert them. If it is difficult doing it as in the video try putting the
    motor can towards an table edge and press on the mount, however don’t press
    on the motor axis while inserting them as it might damage the motor.The
    motor should be inserted all the way to the stop in the mount.</p>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-mounts">insert the motor</h3>
    <p>Insert the motor mounts on the Crazyflie 2.0 wings. They are press fit and
    might need a small amount of force. Make sure they go all the way to the
    stop. It’s not important which motor you put where. After it’s been
    inserted, connect the motor connectors to the Crazyflie 2.0.</p>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-check-propellers">checking the propellers</h3>
    <p>Before attaching the propellers check if they are well balanced. Do this by
    placing a propeller on a needle. Hold the propeller in a horizontal
    position and then release it, if it tilts over it is unbalanced. Balance
    the propeller by attaching a small piece of tape on the side that is
    pointing upwards.</p>

    <h3 id="assembling-balancing">balancing the propellers</h3>
    <p>If the propeller is unbalanced attach tape to the convex side of the
    propeller as shown in the video. The amount of tape that should be used
    varies and you might need some tries to find the correct amount.</p>

    <h3 id="assembling-rubber-pad">attach the rubber pad</h3>
    <p>The rubber pad should be attached to the Crazyflie 2.0 between the
    expansion headers. This will create friction and keep the battery from
    slipping out, as well as protecting the electronics.</p>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="assembling-headers">attach headers</h3>
    <p>There are two types of headers in the box, long and short ones. Find the
    two short ones and insert them into the expansion connector.</p>

    <h3 id="assembling-battery">attach the battery</h3>
    <p>Place the battery between the headers inserted into the expansion connector
    and insert the battery holder board onto the headers. Watch out for the
    pins that can be a bit sharp when inserting it. The friction should hold
    the battery in place so tighten it until it does.</p><p>Now connect the battery
        and you are finished with the assembly. The battery wires can preferably be
    bent and placed underneath the PCB to be out of the way.</p>

    <h3 id="assembling-power-on">power on!</h3>

    <p>The assembly is finished, now it’s time to power it on! Note that the power
    button is a push button, not a sliding button. During the power-on
    self-test all the propellers will spin in sequence. Make sure they all
    spin, if they don’t then check the motor connections.</p>

    <p>Now it's time to do some flying, but first there are som basics you need
        to know about.</p>
</div>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="flying-getting-to-know">getting to know your Crazyflie</h3>
    <p>First of all, you need to understand where the front is, it is much easier
        to fly with the copter pointing away from you. The blue LEDs are in the
        back end, so keep them pointing in your direction when starting to fly.
    </p>

    <div class="plm-img-row"><img
            src="/images/frontCF.png" alt="Crazyflie board from the top"></div>

    <p>You also need to understand what the LEDs mean.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Power on and all is good</strong>: The blue LEDs (2 and 3)
            are fully lit and the front right LED (1) is blinking red twice
            every second.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Radio connected</strong>: The front left LED (4) is flickering
            in read and/or green.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Battery low</strong>: The front right LED (1) is fully lit
            in red. It's time to land and re-charge the battery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Boot loader mode</strong>: The blue LEDs (2 and 3) at the back are
            blinking approximately once every second.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Self test fail</strong>: The right front LED (1) is repeatedly
            blinking five short red pulses with a longer pause between groups.
        </li>

    <h3 id="flying-maneuvering">maneuvering a quadcopter</h3>
    <p>When flying a quadcopter there are four main dimensions of controls; roll, pitch, yaw and thrust.</p>

    <div class="plm-img-row-wide"> <img src="/images/AxisImage.png" alt="Axis"></div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Roll -</strong> is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter from back to front. This literally rolls the Crazyflie and moves it left or right.</li>

        <li> <strong>Pitch -</strong> is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter from left to right. This tilts the Crazyflie and moves it forwards or backwards.</li>

        <li> <strong>Yaw -</strong> is the rotation around a vertical axis. This rotates the quadcopter left or right. Yaw is used when changing flying direction by pionting the front of the Crazyflie in different directions. </li>

        <li><strong>Thrust -</strong> adjusts the altitude, or height, of the Crazyflie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="flying-controll">the mobile app / gamecontroller</h3>
    <p>The controlls on the gamepad or mobile app have the following mapping:</p>

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="flying-normal">normal flight</h3>
    When thrusting without touching any other controls, this is what it might
    look like. The Crazyflie usually drifts in some direction if not
    compensated for, that is completely normal.

<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="flying-ground-effect">the ground effect</h3>
    When the copter is flying close to the ground (less than a few decimeters
    above the ground) it is effected by what is called the ground effect. The
    feeling is that the air is slippery, almost as if it is gliding on ice.
    To avoid this, particularly when learning to fly, use a lot of thrust just
    when taking off and then ease off for level flight.
</div>
<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="flying-unbalanced">if the Crazyflie is unbalanced</h3>
    <p>If your Crazyflie drifts a lot when taking off, there are two thing you
        should check.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the battery is centerd. If it has slipped
        too far to either side, the Crazyflie might have a hard time
        compensating for it.</li>
        
        <li>Check that the propelles are spinning freely.
        Blow lightly on them, one by one, and verify that they turn. A
        a common problem is that hair is jammed between the propeller and
        motor. If this is the problem. just pull the propeller off from the
        motor, remove the hair and reinstall the propeller.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="plm-content-info-step">
    <h3 id="flying-charging">charging the battery</h3>
    <p>To charge the battery of the Crazyflie 2.0, just plug in a micro USB
        cable. Make sure the Crazyflie is powered on. While the battery is charging, the back left blue LED will blink. When the LED is fully lit the battery is charged.</p>
