    <p>The Crazyflie 2.0 is equipeed with a flexible expansion port that
        enables new hardware to be connected. The port is available from both
        sides of the Crazyflie to keep as many options open as possible. The
        port is used by expansion decks to provide new functionality to the
        Crazyflie 2.0 and since the port is availavle from both sides it is possible to attach two decks at the same time.</p>
