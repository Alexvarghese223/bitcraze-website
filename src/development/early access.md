## Early access

We have noticed that people all around the world more and more are reaching out to us about getting hold of the different prototypes we are working with. Since there is a big interest we have decided to start releasing an “early access” version of some of the hardware we are developing.
“Early access” means that the hardware is finalized and available in store, but the software is still in a rudimentary state. Explicitly this means that the hardware will only have basic firmware support.

### Collaborate

The benefits are mutual, we make it possible for our users to get started developing using our hardware at an earlier stage in the development cycle, in return this will provide us with important feedback and contributions towards finalizing the prototypes. 
This approach corresponds greatly to our view on how we want to work and develop our products. We see this as a further way to extend our efforts in collaborating with others in the spirit of open source and sharing knowledge.

### Contribute

For each "early access" project we release we will create a git repo with correlating issues where our community can contribute and work together with us. We announce which prototype we will release in an “early access” state on our blog and you will find them listed on our website as a product. Further information and the link to the exact git repo will be part of the specific product page.
