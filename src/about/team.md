{% gs_step Marcus Eliasson %}
{% img BcTeam-2; small; /images/BcTeam-2.jpg %}
At an early age Marcus was always eager to find out how things worked and managed to take apart quite a few toys without being able to put them back together. He’s always been interested in technology, science and engineering, but the focus of his interest has mostly been software development.
After a few years as a Java developer Marcus wanted to change direction in order to get closer to hardware. Mostly doing C and system design, the best spot to be in is right between hardware and software, getting the first prototype in your lap and starting to write the firmware for it.  After a few years of doing embedded systems consulting Marcus founded Bitcraze together with his two friends and colleagues Tobias and Arnaud.
Being an all arounder Marcus does most things from high level scripting down to low level firmware and to hardware. His favorite thing is being involved in lots of different areas and making a complete system work.

{% img BcTeam-5; small; /images/BcTeam-5.jpg %}
Tobias Antonsson is a born computer and embedded nerd. Ever since he got his first electronics lab kit at an age of eight he has been hooked. He is an all-rounder with experience from computer graphics down to electronic hardware design and thrives best just in between, which makes embedded hardware and software a natural choice. He loves being creative and a lot of his spare time is being spent on various robotic and R/C projects and one of them, the Crazyflie, is becoming his livelihood in his co-founded company Bitcraze AB. Work experience includes mobile, medical and electromechanical industries as well as open source/hardware.
