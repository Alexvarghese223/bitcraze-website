{% include teammember.html member="Arnaud Taffanel" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/BcTeam-1.jpg" bio="
Arnaud have been passionate since childhood by technology. He has worked in various domains from embedded electronics for medical devices to Linux system integration for mobile phones and was working as an Embedded System Consultant when he co-founded Bitcraze.

Arnaud likes embedded system and beautiful code. The best is when he is able to both architecture and design the hardware, write the bootstrap code, and finally architecture the software that runs on it. He also enjoy playing with bigger system like the Bitcraze web servers.

{% include teammember.html member="Björn Mauritz" role="Interaction designer" img="/images/team/BcTeam-3.jpg" bio="
Björn was a big fantasy nerd growing up spending most of his time playing computer games and role-playing “Dragons and demons”. During High school he started doing acting and continued after high school working with theater both on and off stage, besides acting doing stage design construction and lighting design, while also working as a bartender.

In 2011 Björn started studying to be an Interaction designer at Malmö University, graduating with a bachelor degree in 2014. Björn loves to be involved in creative projects and have a specific interest for combining technology and art. 
As a Interaction designer his main interest is researching and understanding how different users behave and how to meet their needs when interacting with for instance a product or a service.

In his spare time he is currently working with making short films and doing stand-up.

{% include teammember.html member="Kristoffer Richardsson" role="Developer" img="/images/team/BcTeam-4.jpg" bio="
With a passion for technology, Kristoffer has been working with various aspects of software development for over 20 years. He has worked on all levels from shifting bits in low level firmware to the architecture of financial systems. In addition to coding, Kristoffer has also a strong interest in how we work, what makes a team tick, what makes us happy, efficient and create fantastic things.

He is a strong believer in lean thinking, the agile movement as well as self organization and he is always looking for improvements. To get a break from software development and logical thinking, Kristoffer can be seen (and heard) from time to time in his tap shoes in the basement. He has taken on the task of spreading the art of tap dance to the rest of the company. He also likes kayaking, skiing, climbing and other outdoor activities, away from the city.

{% include teammember.html member="Marcus Eliasson" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/BcTeam-2.jpg" bio="
At an early age Marcus was always eager to find out how things worked and managed to take apart quite a few toys without being able to put them back together. He’s always been interested in technology, science and engineering, but the focus of his interest has mostly been software development.
After a few years as a Java developer Marcus wanted to change direction in order to get closer to hardware. Mostly doing C and system design, the best spot to be in is right between hardware and software, getting the first prototype in your lap and starting to write the firmware for it. 

After a few years of doing embedded systems consulting Marcus founded Bitcraze together with his two friends and colleagues Tobias and Arnaud.
Being an all arounder Marcus does most things from high level scripting down to low level firmware and to hardware design. His favorite thing is being involved in lots of different areas and making a complete system work.

{% include teammember.html member="Tobias Antonsson" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/BcTeam-5.jpg" bio="
Tobias Antonsson is a born computer and embedded nerd. Ever since he got his first electronics lab kit at an age of eight he has been hooked. He is an all-rounder with experience from computer graphics down to electronic hardware design and thrives best just in between, which makes embedded hardware and software a natural choice. 
He loves being creative and a lot of his spare time is being spent on various robotic and R/C projects and one of them, the Crazyflie, has become his livelihood in his co-founded company Bitcraze AB. Work experience includes mobile, medical and electromechanical industries as well as open source/hardware.
