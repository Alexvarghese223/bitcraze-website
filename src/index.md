      <p>
      Ever wanted a development-kit that flies? We did, so we developed the Crazyflie 
      Nano Quadcopter! The goal with the Crazyflie was to give users a flying base for 
      their development. We wanted to create an open source platform that would be fun 
      to use, as well as give the users the possibility to work on and experiment with 
      a wide range of features and areas.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      In order for users to quickly get going with their flying and development we 
      provide a virtual machine with everything that is needed, documentation of the 
      project and design as well as a range of different software. Flying is done 
      from our main client software where you can use a variety of joysticks as well 
      as the Leap Motion. You can also use our custom SD-card image for flying from 
      the Raspberry Pi or our Android client for flying from your smartphone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      We are constantly working on improving the design and trying to come up with 
      fun new hacks and experiments that we implement and show users how to do. 
      Through our community everyone get the chance to join in the discussion and 
      development as well as take part and contribute to all the documentation.
