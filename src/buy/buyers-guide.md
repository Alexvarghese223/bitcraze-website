## I just want to fly the Crazyflie 2.0, what do I need to get?

The Crazyflie 2.0 comes with everything you need for flying from a **Bluetooth LE 
enabled mobile device**. You can also get the separately sold **Crazyradio PA** for 
connecting to the computer and using a **[gamepad](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:pc_utils:inputdevices)**.

## I want to use the Crazyflie 2.0 for development, what do I need to get?

When doing development for the Crazyflie 2.0 using the **Crazyradio PA USB dongle** 
is a good idea. This enables you to make use of the APIs for the computer which 
contains our logging and parameter framework that makes development a lot 
easier. If you are planning on doing lots of firmware development, then itâ€™s 
always a good idea to get JTAG/SWD access to the platform for debugging. With 
our **debug adapter kit** you can connect your normal JTAG/SWD debugger easily.
