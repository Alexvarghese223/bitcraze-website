Note: gamepad is not included

## I want to use the Crazyflie 2.0 for advanced development

A lot can be achieved with the Crazyflie 2.0 and the Crazyradio PA only, but for
advanced development JTAG/SWD access to the platform is useful.
The [Debug adapter kit](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/accessories/products/debug-adapter)
enables you to connect your normal JTAG/SWD debugger to
the Crazyflie 2.0 to set break points, single step and so on when debugging.

**What to buy:** [Happy hacker bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/happy-hacker-bundle)

Note: JTAG/SWD debugger is not included

## I want to add a sensor to the Crazyflie 2.0

The expansion ports on the Crazyflie 2.0 enables you to connect more or less
any hardware you like. When prototyping the Breakout deck is useful as you can
use it to connect your Crazyflie 2.0 to a bread board and easily debug your
hardware design. When satisfied with the design you can transfer it to a Prototyping
deck for a more permanent implementation. If you want to take it even further,
why not manufacture a [deck PCB](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie2-exp-template-electronics) and add Female deck connectors.

**What to buy:** [Breakout deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/breakout-deck),
[Prototyping deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/prototyping-deck),
[Female deck connectors](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/female-deck-connector)

## I want to paint in the dark with a Crazyflie

The Crazyflie 2.0 is fun to fly as is but adding the LED-ring deck and flying
in the dark adds a new dimension. The RGB LEDs lets you chose any colour and with
some coding any light sequence can be displayed, for instance controlled by the
on board sensors.      
Why not take photos with an open shutter of a moving Crayflie 2.0 and paint in
the dark?

**What to buy:** [The LED-ring deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/led-ring-deck)

## I want the Crazyflie to give feedback using sound and light

The LED-ring deck can be used to display light in any color and the Buzzer deck
can make sounds, useful for giving the user feedback. For automated implementation
it can be very handy to indicate when the system is ready, error states or similar.

**What to buy:** [The Artist bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/the-estetik-bundle),
[the Buzzer deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/buzzer-deck)

## I want a bigger Crazyflie 2.0

The BigQuad deck is used to control a bigger quad copter frame with a Crazyflie 2.0.
Remove the motors on the Crazyflie, add the BigQuad deck and mount it on a bigger
frame. Connect the motor controllers (ESCs) for the brushless motors of the frame
to the BigQuad deck and you are ready to go. You get the full echosystem of the
Crazyflie 2.0 but super sized.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/getting-started-bundle),
[BigQuad deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/bigquad-deck)

Note: the bigger frame, brushless motors and ESCs are not included

## I want wireless charging of my Crazyflie

The Qi deck gives the Crazyflie wireless charging capabilities. The battery is
automatically charged when the Crazyflie 2.0 is placed on top of a wireless charger,
no need to connect a cable.

**What to buy:** [Qi wireless charging deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/qi-wireless-charging-deck)

Note: wireless charger not included

## I want to record data when flying my Crazyflie 2.0

If large volumes of data needs to be recorded when flying, the Crazyradio PA might
not have sufficient bandwidth in some cases. The SD-card deck adds access to the
filesystem of a SD card and enables storage of any data.

**What to buy:** [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included

## I want to use a SD-card for configuration of a Crazyflie

The SD-card deck can be used to store configuration data for a Crazyflie. An
example could be an autonomous implementation where the Crazyflie is not connected
via radio. The configuration can be written to a SD-card in a computer and the
SD-card is transferred to the Crazyflie before it is started. This is also a
way to separate configuration from hardware/firmware and avoid flashing
different firmware to Crazyflie individuals.   

**What to buy:** [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included

## I want assistance when flying the Crazyflie

Flying a quad copter like the Crazyflie manually requires some skill and
practising. By adding the Z-ranger deck or Flow deck the Crazyflie gets more
information about its motion and can assist the pilot.

Currently assisted mode is only support when flying using a computer and
gamepad, not with a mobile device.

### The Z-ranger deck

The Z-ranger deck measures the distance to the ground and can be used
to automatically stay at a constant height, while the pilot can focus on the
position.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Z-ranger deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/z-ranger-deck)

Note: the gamepad is not included

### The Flow deck

The Flow deck takes it even further by also detecting the motion of the Crazyflie
relative to the ground. This enables a flight mode where the pilot tells      
the system which direction to go rather than the tilt of the quad copter, by
releasing the controls the Crazyflie simply stays hovering on the spot.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/flow-deck?variant=42407121301)

Note: the gamepad is not included

## I want to fly autonomously and control the Crazyflie 2.0 from a computer

For fully autonomous flight the Crazyflie must get position data from an
external source, the internal sensors are only good for one or a few seconds of
flight. When the Crazyflie has more position information it is possible to
control it by using commands to tell it how to move or where to go, either from
an internal progam or from an external computer.

There are a number of option of how to provide position information and they
all have different properties.

### The Flow deck

With the Flow deck the Crazyflie gets the distance to, and the relative
motion relative to the surface under it. With this information it can hover
in one spot or follow a trajectory. The advantage of this solution is that it
does not require any external systems and comes at a very good price.

Since the position information is relative the Crazyflie does not really know
where it is and any motion will be based on the starting position. Further more
the position will drift over time, but in most cases autonomous flight can be
maintained up to a minute.  

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/flow-deck?variant=42407121301)

### The Loco Positioning System

With the Loco Positioning system the Crazyflie calculates its absolute position in
space, and it is all done in the Crazyflie! With the absolute position it
always knows where it is and since the position estimation is done in the drone
it is also possible to fly truly autonomously without a connection to an external
computer. The location precision of the loco positioning system is about +/-10cm.

**What to buy:** [Indoor Explorer bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/indoor-explorer-bundle)

### Camera based system

Camera based systems such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can be used to
measure the position of a Crazyflie with high precision. In these systems the
position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflie in real time via radio.
Depending of the camera system and its configuration the location precision of
a camera motion tracking system can be down to millimeters.

**What to buy:** Contact us for further information and solution support  

## I want to fly a swarm

Swarm flight with the Crazyflie is similar to autonomous flight with the added
complexity of positioning multiple drones simultaneously and making sure they
move along trajectories that avoid collisions. There are some support in the
system for swarms but this requires a lot of understanding and at least some
coding, depending on solution.

Again, a key to swarming is the positioning technology and its properties.

### The Flow deck

It is possible to fly small swarms (we have done 5) using the Flow deck. Since
the path each Crazyflie follows is relative to its starting position this solution
is sensitive to correct positioning and smooth take off. It is hard or impossible
to recover from problems so it is not very reliable, but fun!  

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundles](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Flow decks](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/flow-deck?variant=42407121301)

### The Loco Positioning System

The default mode (Two way ranging) of the Loco Positioning system supports
positioning of one Crazyflie and to position multiple Crazyflies the TDoA mode
must be used. The TDoA mode is available in the source code but is still considered
experimental and requires some extra configuration. The TDoA mode works like an
indoor GPS system and each Crazyflie only listens to positioning information from the
anchors which makes it possible to position a large number of drones.
Due to the nature of TDoA the position estimation works best in the space
inside the anchors (the convex hull) and we recommend using 8 anchors for TDoA.

**What to buy:** [Indoor Explorer bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/bundles/products/indoor-explorer-bundle),
2 x [Loco positioning node](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/positioning/products/loco-positioning-node),
[Crazyflies](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/kits/products/crazyflie-2-0),
[Loco Positioning decks](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/positioning/products/loco-positioning-deck)

### Camera based system

Camera based systems such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can track many markers
simultaneously. To identify individual Crazyflies different physical configurations of
markers can be used on each individual or an external system can keep track of
the motion of markers to understand which drone that is connected to a marker.
Again the position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflies in real time via radio.
There are frameworks (for examle [Crazy Swarm](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm)) written by the community to handle these types of system and
swarms of up to 50 Crazyflies.
